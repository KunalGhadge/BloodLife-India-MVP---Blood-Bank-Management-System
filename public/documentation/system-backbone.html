            <h2>29. The Brain of the App (State)</h2>
            <p>How does the app remember that you just added a donor without needing to refresh the whole screen? That’s
                where <strong>State Management</strong> comes in. We call it the "Single Source of Truth."</p>

            <div class="jargon-heavy"
                style="font-family: var(--font-sans); border-left-color: #ec4899; background: #fdf2f8; color: #9d174d;">
                Tech Explained: <strong>The AppState</strong>. It's a single object that holds ALL the information
                currently being shown on the screen.
            </div>

            <h3>How "State" Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> You fill out a donor form and click "Save."</li>
                <li><strong>Action:</strong> An action is triggered (like <code>addDonor</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Update:</strong> The "State Object" is updated with the new donor.</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction:</strong> React sees that the state has changed and automatically "re-draws" the
                    parts of the screen that need to show the new donor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Centralized Control</h3>
            <p>Instead of every component having its own complex memory, we keep the important stuff (donors, requests,
                and stock) in a central hub. This prevents bugs like two different parts of the app showing different
                donor counts.</p>

            <h3>Persistence Link</h3>
            <p>Every time the state changes, we "sync" it to the <a href="data-persistence-layer.html">local
                    storage</a>. This ensures that the state isn't just in the app's brain but is also safely written to
                the user's hard drive.</p>
