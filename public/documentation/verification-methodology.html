            <h2>20. Ensuring Quality and Reliability</h2>
            <p>Before any piece of code is released, it goes through a rigorous testing process. We want to make sure
                that the "MatchFinder" never fails and that donor data is always handled correctly.</p>

            <div class="jargon-heavy"
                style="font-family: var(--font-sans); border-left-color: #22c55e; background: #f0fdf4; color: #166534;">
                Our Mantra: <strong>Zero Tolerance for Bugs</strong>. In a system that helps save lives, technical
                reliability is an ethical requirement.

            <h3>How We Verify Our App</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> We use <strong>ESLint</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong> to
                    catch errors *while we are coding*, before the app is even run.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Walkthroughs:</strong> Our team performs "End-to-End" tests—simulating a user
                    creating a request, finding a donor, and completing a match.</li>
                <li><strong>Edge Case Testing:</strong> We deliberately try to break the app by entering weird data
                    (like negative unit counts) to see if the validation layers catch it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Continuous Integration (CI)</h3>
            <p>Every time a developer pushes code to GitHub, an automated script runs to check if the project still
                "builds" successfully. If there's a problem, the script stops the process before the broken code can
                reach any users.</p>

            <h3>User Feedback Loop</h3>
            <p>We rely on our community of users to report anomalies. If something feels slow or doesn't work as
                expected, we treat it as a top priority for our next verification cycle.</p>
