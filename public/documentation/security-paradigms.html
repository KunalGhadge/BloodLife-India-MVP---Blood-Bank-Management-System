            <h2>15. Keeping Donor Data Secure</h2>
            <p>Security and Privacy are or top priorities. Since BloodLife deals with humanitarian data, we use several
                "Zero-Trust" strategies to ensure information remains in the right hands.</p>

            <div class="jargon-heavy"
                style="font-family: var(--font-sans); border-left-color: #6366f1; background: #eef2ff; color: #3730a3;">
                Our approach: <strong>Privacy by Design</strong>. We build security into the bedrock of the app rather
                than adding it as an afterthought.
            </div>

            <h3>Local-First Security</h3>
            <p>The best way to protect data is to not store it on an unsecured server. By keeping donor records on
                *your* device, we eliminate the risk of large-scale data breaches at a central location.</p>

            <h3>Sanitizing Input</h3>
            <p>We use strict "Escaping" rules to prevent malicious scripts from being run within the app (XSS
                protection). Every piece of text entered by a user is treated as untrusted and "sanitized" before it's
                displayed on the screen.</p>

            <h3>The Minimalist Policy</h3>
            <p>We only collect the data we *need*. By avoiding unnecessary personal identifiers (like full government
                IDs), we reduce the risk to donors while still maintaining an effective matching system.</p>
