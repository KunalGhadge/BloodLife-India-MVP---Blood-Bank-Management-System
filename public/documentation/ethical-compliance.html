            <h2>24. Ethics and Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Managing records of blood donation is a sacred responsibility. We hold ourselves to the highest ethical
                standards when it comes to data privacy and the management of biological resources.</p>

                style="font-family: var(--font-sans); border-left-color: #059669; background: #ecfdf5; color: #064e3b;">
                Our Pledge: <strong>Altruism Over Profit</strong>. BloodLife is and will always be a tool for the public
                good.

            <h3>Data Stewardship</h3>
            <p>We believe that your data belongs to you. We do not sell or share donor information with third-party
                advertisers. Our local-first approach ensures that sensitive contact details are kept out of massive,
                centralized databases.</p>

            <h3>Fair Allocation</h3>
            <p>The system is designed to provide fair, unbiased donor matching based purely on medical compatibility and
                urgency. We explicitly forbid any algorithms that prioritize requests based on non-medical factors.</p>

            <h3>Respecting Donors</h3>
            <p>Donors are the heroes of this system. We ensure that their privacy is protected and that they are only
                contacted for genuine, medical needs. We provide clear ways for donors to "opt-out" or take a break from
                the active registry at any time.</p>
