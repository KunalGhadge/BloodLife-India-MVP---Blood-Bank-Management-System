            <h2>01. Project Overview and Goals</h2>
            <p>BloodLife India is an Open Source Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to streamline blood bank
                management. In a country where every drop counts, our system aims to bridge the gap between blood
                donors, hospitals, and those in urgent need.</p>

            <div class="jargon-heavy"
                style="font-family: var(--font-sans); border-left-color: #3b82f6; background: #eff6ff; color: #1e40af;">
                Note: While the project uses advanced React patterns, the goal is always "User First." We prioritize
                speed and reliability over complex jargon.

            <h3>Why BloodLife?</h3>
            <p>Traditional blood bank systems are often slow, centralized, and require heavy internet usage. BloodLife
                is built differently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local-First:</strong> Uses your browser's local storage to save data, making it work even
                    when the internet is spotty.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Matching:</strong> Automatically suggests the best donors for a specific blood request
                    based on compatibility (ABO and Rh factors).</li>
                <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Completely free for anyone to use, modify, and improve.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Mission</h3>
            <p>Our technical mission is to create a robust, type-safe application using modern web technologies like
                React 19 and TypeScript. We want to provide a "premium" experience that feels like a high-end
                application while being lightweight enough for any device.</p>
