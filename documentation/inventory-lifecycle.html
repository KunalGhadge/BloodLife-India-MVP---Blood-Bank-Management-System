            <h2>07. Managing the Blood Inventory</h2>
            <p>Keeping track of blood units is critical for any blood bank. BloodLife provides a detailed inventory
                management system to track every donation from the moment it's received until it's used.</p>

            <div class="jargon-heavy"
                style="font-family: var(--font-sans); border-left-color: #f97316; background: #fff7ed; color: #9a3412;">
                Important Metric: <strong>Shelf Life</strong>. Blood is a biological resource and has a limited lifespan
                (usually around 35-42 days for red blood cells).
            </div>

            <h3>Tracking the Lifecycle</h3>
            <p>Every blood unit in the inventory has a "Lifecycle":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Available:</strong> The unit is fresh and ready to be used.</li>
                <li><strong>Reserved:</strong> The unit has been assigned to a specific request.</li>
                <li><strong>Used:</strong> The unit has been successfully transfused.</li>
                <li><strong>Expired:</strong> The unit has passed its safety date and should be safely discarded.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dashboard Visibility</h3>
            <p>The main dashboard provides a "Stock Level" chart. This allows admins to see at a glance which blood
                groups are running low, ensuring they can proactively reach out to donors before an emergency occurs.
            </p>

            <h3>Safety Notifications</h3>
            <p>The system automatically flags units that are nearing their expiration date, helping blood bank managers
                prioritize older units first (FIFO - First In, First Out logic).</p>
